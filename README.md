# Random-scripts
some random scripts and ideas i code to practice my python skills:

getfile.py- Gets files from the thinkpython webpage and downloads them to current directory

morse_code.py - Encodes and decodes morse code, it automatically checks which method to use either decode or encode
a message

count_files.py - Counts the number of files in a directory plus sub-directories

pycon.py - An attempt to get all videos of pycon from youtube that are not already in my directory. Depends on command-line program [youtube-dl] (https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl)

sort_playlist.py - Sorts a folder full of music files by using beet to download the meta data and move the songs appropriately
must have beets installed in your system.
